# Bootstrap-Portfolio
# In this project I have downloaded necessary tools and copied some of the codes from the bootstrap website.
# Created html and CSS file, added code from bootstrap for the navbar. 
# Added image, resized them and designed the navigation bar and bottoms, link.
# Some of the website and YouTube video that were useful and has been used to finish this project:
# https://getbootstrap.com
# https://youtu.be/N_qdcjlH-2s?si=shiyyroZBlyOJIAm
# https://developers.google.com/fonts
# For map; https://leafletjs.com/download.html
# Unfortunately, the map is not working as it should. The issue will be solved later.
